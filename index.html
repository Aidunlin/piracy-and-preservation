      <h2>Dear Nintendo,</h2>
      <p><strong>Piracy is a problem</strong>. It is a massive, worldwide issue that plagues all game developers, companies, and studios. When someone pirates a game or illegally copies and shares a game over the internet, the dedicated team (and company) behind that game <em>gets absolutely nothing in return</em>. According to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com.au/legal/information" target="_blank" title="Legal Information | Nintendo">your website</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>"Nintendo and its over 100 independent publishers and developers, lose <strong>hundreds of millions of dollars per year</strong> to international pirates and counterfeiters."</blockquote>
      <p>Your company has spent years trying to prevent these losses and other attempts at infringing your intellectual property (IP) rights, whether it's <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/nintendo-rom-site-owner-to-pay-12-million-for-game-piracy" target="_blank" title="Nintendo ROM Site Owner To Pay $12 Million For Game Piracy | PCMag">shutting down ROM websites</a>, or <a href="https://www.cbr.com/most-infamous-nintendo-fan-game-shutdowns/" target="_blank" title="Nintendo's 10 Most Infamous Shutdowns Of Fan Games | CBR">shutting down fan projects</a>.</p>
      <p>Why do people pirate Nintendo games? Why do Nintendo ROM sites exist? Yes, many people pirate video games to explicitly avoid paying for the product. However, there are two other major factors at play here: <strong>availability</strong> and <strong>service</strong>.</p>
      <h2>Value in availability</h2>
      <p>Over the last few video game console generations, your library of classic/retro games on each console has shrunk down considerably:</p>

      <p>With both the 3DS and Wii U Virtual Consoles becoming unavailable soon (due to the closure of their respective online stores), that leaves Nintendo Switch Online as the only convenient and legal way to still play classic Nintendo games. Acquiring consoles, cartridges, and controllers to be able to play each retro game no longer available after the 3DS/Wii U eShop closes is nowhere near "convenient", <a href="https://youtu.be/f35i5AVzpsg?t=325" target="_blank">as explained by YouTuber Nerrel</a> (5:25-5:50).</p>
      <p>Why bother with Nintendo Switch Online's pitiful retro library size when ROM sites offer hundreds or thousands of classic games, including ones that aren't (or won't be) sold by Nintendo? According to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com.au/legal/information" target="_blank" title="Legal Information | Nintendo">your website</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>"The problem is that it's illegal. Copyrights and trademarks of games are corporate assets. If these vintage titles are available far and wide, it undermines the value of this intellectual property and adversely affects the right owner. In addition, the assumption that the games involved are vintage or nostalgia games is incorrect. Nintendo is famous for bringing back to life its popular characters for its newer systems, for example, Mario and Donkey Kong have enjoyed their adventures on all Nintendo platforms, going from coin-op machines to our latest hardware platforms."</blockquote>
      <p>Many of the games involved are absolutely vintage/retro/nostalgia, if it wasn't obvious by the fan projects and ROM sites you have shut down. Many fan projects featured retro-based aesthetics mimicing your older titles, and many ROM sites included games from the NES, SNES, and other old platforms.</p>
      <p>And while you continue to bring your popular characters back to life in new video games on new systems, you continue to make the legacy games of those characters difficult (or impossible) to enjoy.</p>
      <h2>Value in service</h2>
      <p>Over 11 years ago, Valve co-founder Gabe Newell <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2011/experiments-video-game-economics-valves-gabe-newell/" target="_blank">explained in an interview</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>"One thing that we have learned is that piracy is not a pricing issue. It's a service issue. The easiest way to stop piracy is.... by giving those people a service that's better than what they're receiving from the pirates."</blockquote>
